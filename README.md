# README

This is a Ruby on Rails application that provides a landing site for my client, Lily Vernon, and her personal training business.

The site will begin by being an information platform for her services. It will gradually expand to include payment options and different fitness/diet plans. 

When the application is downloaded to your local machine you will have to configure the database permissions in the database.yml file to be congruent with your system.

Run 'rails db:create' and then 'rails db:migrate' to instantiate the database.

Run the server with the command 'rails s'.
